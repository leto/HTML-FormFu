=head1 NAME

HTML::FormFu::Constraint::Callback - Code Callback Constraint

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $form->constraint({
        type => 'Callback',
        name => 'foo',
        callback => \&sfoo,
    );
    
    sub foo {
        my ( $value, $params ) = @_;

        # return true or false
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The first argument passed to the callback is the submitted value for the 
associated field. The second argument passed to the callback is a hashref of 
name/value pairs for all input fields.

This constraint doesn't honour the C<not()> value.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 callback

Arguments: \&sub_ref

=head1 SEE ALSO

Is a sub-class of, and inherits methods from L<HTML::FormFu::Constraint>

L<HTML::FormFu::FormFu>

=head1 LIMITATIONS

The callback code-ref is copied internally using L<Storable/dclone>. It 
seems that because of this, the coderef does not act as a true closure, and 
cannot refer to variables and subroutines that would otherwise be in scope. 
This need further investigation.

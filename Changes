    - New HTML::FormFu::Model::DBIC module to replace DBIx::Class::HTML::FormFu
    
    - New Repeatable block element
    
    - New "nested" params support. Form and Block elements have a new 
      nested_name() method. Field elements have new nested(), nested_name() 
      and nested_names() methods. Doesn't require CGI::Expand or 
      Catalyst::Plugin::NestedParams
    
    - Uses new "string" renderer by default - doesn't use template files,
      Generated markup still exactly the same,
      Set render_method("tt") to use the template files (old behaviour),

      Template files now installed into @INC path by File::ShareDir,

      the field names

      'label_loc' argument, to provide the item labels via localize()

      $form->render->end_form() must be changed to $form->end,
      $form->render->field('foo') must be changed to $form->get_field('foo'),
      $form->render->hidden_fields() must be changed to $form->hidden_fields()

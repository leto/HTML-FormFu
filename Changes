	- New HTML::FormFu::Model::DBIC module to replace DBIx::Class::HTML::FormFu
	
	- New Repeatable block element
	
	- New "nested" params support. Form and Block elements have a new 
	  nested_name() method. Field elements have new nested(), nested_name() 
	  and nested_names() methods. Doesn't require CGI::Expand or 
	  Catalyst::Plugin::NestedParams
	
	- Uses new "string" renderer by default - doesn't use template files,
	  Generated markup still exactly the same,
	  Set render_method("tt") to use the template files (old behaviour),
	  render_class_args() renamed to tt_args(),
	  Template files now installed into @INC path by File::ShareDir,
	  INCLUDE_PATH no longer set by default
	
	- New Checkboxgroup element. Works much like Radiogroup, but with
      checkboxes
    
    - Support multiple yaml documents in a single file - calls populate()
      once for each document
	
	- Date element now uses names of the form "date_day" instead of 
	  "date.day", so as to not conflict with the new nested-params. This 
	  should only affect you if your client-side code (CSS, JS) references 
	  the field names
    
    - Group elements (Select, Radiogroup, Checkboxgroup) now support a
      'label_loc' argument, to provide the item labels via localize()
    
    - *_loc() methods now accept an arrayref argument, to allowing setting
      in YAML config files
    
    - render() now returns a string, not an object.
	  $form->render->start_form() must be changed to $form->start(),
	  $form->render->end_form() must be changed to $form->end,
	  $form->render->field('foo') must be changed to $form->get_field('foo'),
	  $form->render->hidden_fields() must be changed to $form->hidden_fields()
    
    - Bugfix: OutputProcessor::Indent was indenting closing tag, when it's
      value was empty (RT 30239)
    
    - Bugfix: Objects were getting wrong parents during clone() and
      auto_fieldset()
